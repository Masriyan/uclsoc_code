## Purpose
These use cases help security professionals develop effective SIEM detection rules, providing a structured approach to:
- Detecting cyber threats across different security domains
- Enhancing security operations and incident response
- Aligning SIEM rules with frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK**

## How to Use
### Setting Up
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SIEM-Use-Cases.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd SIEM-Use-Cases
   ```

### Implementing Use Cases
1. Choose the relevant category based on your SIEM needs.
2. Review the **pseudocode** and **detection logic** in the corresponding `.md` file.
3. Convert the logic into detection rules for your SIEM platform (Splunk, ELK, Sentinel, QRadar, etc.).
4. Customize the detection thresholds and parameters to fit your environment.
5. Test and validate the rules in a controlled environment before deploying them in production.

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly update the threat detection rules based on new intelligence.
- Integrate **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** for enhanced threat mapping.
- Monitor **false positives and false negatives** to fine-tune detection logic.
- Collaborate with the security team to improve detection efficiency.
