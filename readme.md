## Purpose
These use cases help security professionals develop effective SIEM detection rules, providing a structured approach to:
- Detecting cyber threats across different security domains
- Enhancing security operations and incident response
- Aligning SIEM rules with frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK**

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the relevant category and review the use cases.
2. Implement the pseudocode logic in your SIEM system.
3. Customize thresholds and parameters based on your organization's needs.
4. Continuously refine detection rules based on evolving threat intelligence.
